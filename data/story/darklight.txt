The city of darklight is a mysterious and dangerous place. 
But it does look quite beautiful. 
Try making it home before its too late 
Too late for what
For Overheat
Overheat?
No one has ever survived the overheat. Legends has it that one sees the true nature of darklight when one is overheated.


#Level 1
Oh you have survived the day, I thought you wouldn't
â€¦
What brings you here
Hmm.. uou know hiking
No one visits the ruins of darklight for hiking, stop lying
Few days ago my brother visited this place on his geography trip
Oh yeah I did see some school students, I did warn them 
He never returned, so I am looking for him 
I am really sorry, but I believe he is captured by the red hoodies
The red what?
They are a ruthless tribe who flourish in this ruined city. 
Oh 
They are the ones who cursed this beautiful place with overheat
Oh it must be them, they captured my little brother.
Enough talk lets take some rest, don't want to get overheated

#Level 2
Oh hi there
I found my brother's cap I believe I am in the right path
Wait were you just overheated.
Yeah I guess so 
Only the descendants of the king of shadows can survive in the overheated state.
My great-grandfather was no king of shadows
Wait is it true that you saw a ghost
Yeah it almost got me
The ghosts are the spirits of the lost souls who perished overheated
Is there a way to restore this place 
Legend has it that the only true descendent of the king of the shadows can restore this place.
Oh
Lest's take some rest now
